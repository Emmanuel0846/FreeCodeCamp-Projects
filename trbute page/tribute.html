        <h3 id="headline">A Tribute to Myles Munroe:</h3>
        <p>While many remember Dr. Munroe for delivering exceptional teaching on topics such as purpose, potential, vision, praise and worship, leadership, and even relationships, perhaps no revelation has attracted more attention—and thus, has been more integral to the shifting of the landscape of the church—as his message on the Kingdom of God.</p>

        <p>In this respect, Dr. Munroe served as a pioneer and prophetic voice, summoning the church to lift up its eyes, and start embracing its heavenly inheritance now instead of just holding out for the afterlife.</p>
        
       <p> In commemoration of a year since his home-going, it is worth noting that Dr. Munroe was a key figure when it came to herald- ing the Gospel of the Kingdom. From the release of his ground- breaking book, Rediscovering the Kingdom, onward, Dr. Munroe laid out a revelatory biblical blueprint for what the fullness of the Gospel looks like. Certainly, these thoughts attracted both enthusiastic acclaim and reactionary antagonism, as he was calling Christians to question whether or not they were actually walking in the fullness of what Jesus described as “the gospel of the kingdom” (Matthew 24:14). Perhaps many believers assumed they were experiencing the zenith of their Christian lives; Dr. Munroe was a voice calling them to never settle, never quit, and constantly press in for the “glory to glory” journey about which apostle Paul wrote.</p>
